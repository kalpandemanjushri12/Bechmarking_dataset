# **Benchmarking Resources**
1. **hg38_100kb_markers.zip** :
A collection of FASTA marker files generated for the human reference genome (hg38) using the marker generation R script.
Each marker sequence is 2 kb in length and spaced 100 kb apart across all chromosomes.

2. **markers_generation.R** :
An R script that creates fixed-length genomic markers from chromosome FASTA files.
It was used to generate the hg38 marker set included in this repository.

3. **Dot_plot.py** : Python script generates quadraplots for visualizing genomic marker distributions across different coverages and populations.
