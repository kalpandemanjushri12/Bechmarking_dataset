# **Benchmarking Resources**
1. **Dot_plot.py** : Python script generates quadraplots for visualizing genomic marker distributions across different coverages and populations.

2. **hg38_100kb_markers.zip** :
A collection of FASTA marker files generated for the human reference genome (hg38) using the marker generation R script.
Each marker sequence is 2 kb in length and spaced 100 kb apart across all chromosomes.

3. **markers_generation.R** :
An R script that creates fixed-length genomic markers from chromosome FASTA files.
It was used to generate the marker set included in this repository.

4. **t2t_100kb_markers.zip** :
A collection of FASTA marker files generated for the T2T-CHM13v2.0 using the marker generation script.
Each marker sequence is 2 kb in length and spaced 100 kb apart across all chromosomes.

5. **Calculate_N50_L50.sh** :
A python script which will calculate the N50 and L50 assembly quality check metrices of the genome sequence.
